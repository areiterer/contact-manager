This is a React demo project that contains a bunch of functionality that you'll possibly need in a lot of React projects. I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible so it's suitable for React beginners to learn about React.

## Contents

* [x] Navigation with [react-router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [x] Master / Detail View
* [x] CRUD operations with a REST API (see [contact-manager-backend](https://github.com/areiterer/contact-manager-backend))
* [x] CSS styling (imported CSS files)
* [ ] Authentication

## How to test

* If you want to test it, please be sure to have the [contact-manager-backend](https://github.com/areiterer/contact-manager-backend) running.

```
git clone https://github.com/areiterer/contact-manager
cd contact-manager
npm install
npm start
```

## Roadmap

There are still a lot of things to be fixed here.

* [ ] Improve Component / State design
* [ ] Tests are missing
* [ ] ...
